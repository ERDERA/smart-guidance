# ERDERA co-creation assessment questionnaire
Co-creation generally relates to involving the final consumer in the creation process of a product or a service. In the case of ERDERA’s Data Service Hub (DSH), co-creation would involve a collaboration between the FAIR experts in the Data Services Hub and the domain experts who are the Data Controllers for the resource. Both parties are responsible for creating the final contribution to ERDERA’s eco-system. Note that, in the co-creation model, the DSH is not a “service provider”, but rather a collaborative partner, and the degree to which each party is responsible for the final outcome is decided by a triage process when the Data Controller approaches ERDERA to propose their data resource be a recognised FAIR resource. In order to kick-start the collaboration, acting as the first interaction with the collaborators, the DSH has developed this questionnaire aimed at the data controllers. The main goal is to assist the domain experts to assess their RD data current status and to help the DSH estimate and assign resources efficiently to further collaborate on Co-creation. This questionnaire does that by guiding the domain expert through FAIR-enabling tools and standards, such as different data models developed or recommended by ERDERA experts.

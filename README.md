# Smart Guidance WG

The Smart Guidance tool was built to ease the FAIRification process for ERN registries. This tool is designed for data stewards of registries who are about to start or are in the process of FAIRification of their registry data. This is an online questionnaire-based tool, developed upon the Data Steward Wizard (DSW). The output of this tool would be a FAIRification plan tailored to that resourceâ€™s current status. The recommendations made in the tool will be based on solutions used, discovered or built in the EJP RD. The advice is planned to be highly technical and will point to training sessions or tools that will facilitate the implementation of these technical solutions.  

Too available at https://smartguidance-rd.ds-wizard.org/ and can be accessed after signing in.

## User guide
The Data stewardship Wizard (DSW) tool was primarily built for data stewards to make a data management plan in collaboration with other members of their team. The questionnaire style tool can be adapted for other types of questionnaires which is why we decided to build our Smart Guidance questionnaire in this tool rather than build software from scratch.  
The user guide for the DSW is available here for more detailed instructions on the platform itself. 

The first step is to sign up for an account.  We recommend that you use your institutional credentials for your account.

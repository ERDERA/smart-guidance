generated by yourself in an earlier project, or data from others (Barend Mons calls this \"Other PEople's Data And Services\" or OPEDAS). This can include reusable data that have been created for an earlier study, and also so-called \"reference data\" which is used by many projects.\n\nIt is not because we can generate massive amounts of data that we always need to do so. Creating data with public money is bringing with it the responsibility to treat those data well and (if potentially useful) make them available for re-use by others.

[ds-km@da5a8fc](https://github.com/ds-wizard/ds-km/commit/da5a8fc95d0a67f9369ce0b7727615115fc3656d).\n\nThe FAIRsharing integration requires configuration to contain `apiUrl` and `apiKey` for integration with id `fairsharing`.\n\n### 1.3.0\n\n* Refactoring list questions because of **deprecated item title** fields, i.e., a new question for item title created for each list question.\n\nWhen

on any new study, it is good practice to check all options to re-use existing available data, either collected or generated by yourself in an earlier project, or data from others (Barend Mons calls this \"Other PEople's Data And Services\" or OPEDAS). This can include reusable data that have been created for an earlier study, and also so-called \"reference data\" which is used by many projects.\n\nIt is not because we can generate massive amounts of data that we always need to do so. Creating data with public money is bringing with it the responsibility to treat those data well and (if potentially useful) make them available for re-use by others.

This requires either keywords or ontology terms describing what is in the data.\n* There is metadata describing how the data can be re-used, such as license information and, for data about people, the extent of their consent for data reuse.\n* There is metadata that makes the data understandable, e.g. linking to the exact processes used to collect them (is a *body temperature* measured under the tongue or in the rectum?) and units (is a temperature given in Celsius or Fahrenheit?). \n* There is metadata describing where the data comes from and what it is useful for. For frequently used data types, there are often very well defined metadata standards, in other cases you may need to think about this yourself.\nFor each of these kinds of metadata there are specific standards. There is no single standard that will get you all the metadata needed to make the data as FAIR as possible.\n","changed":true},"annotations":{"changed":false},"createdAt":"2020-11-16T12:36:52.81Z","entityUuid":"6d18bfff-0f53-469b-934e-9806dda9d4fb","eventType":"EditAnswerEvent","followUpUuids":{"changed":false},"label":{"changed":false},"uuid":"413f05af-d68d-413e-bc14-0e299a67e05f","parentUuid":"8c962e6f-17ee-4b22-8ebb-9f06f779e3b3","metricMeasures":{"changed":false}},{"annotations":[],"createdAt":"2020-11-16T12:36:52.81Z","text":null,"entityUuid":"f99b1723-c8e4-44b9-af22-f66955eda1e2","questionType":"OptionsQuestion","eventType":"AddQuestionEvent","title":"Will there be different versions of this data over time?","requiredPhaseUuid":"adc9133d-afcd-4616-9aea-db5f475898a2","tagUuids":[],"uuid":"bcd64d32-3ef1-41b4-914e-fd173fb9fe09","parentUuid":"8d1b07a7-f177-41f5-9532-05536223a8d6"},{"advice":null,"annotations":[],"createdAt":"2020-11-16T12:36:52.81Z","entityUuid":"41c0631f-c3d4-4c77-a293-ed0090f855e0","eventType":"AddAnswerEvent","label":"No","uuid":"6592f8fa-28be-4a22-8e0d-9430cfd2f6ea","parentUuid":"f99b1723-c8e4-44b9-af22-f66955eda1e2","metricMeasures":[]},{"advice":null,"annotations":[],"createdAt":"2020-11-16T12:36:52.81Z","entityUuid":"facde7e9-8711-4ced-a6f8-5fbacf929381","eventType":"AddAnswerEvent","label":"Yes","uuid":"69369d45-e554-4617-bb67-ef3f50aa8b64","parentUuid":"f99b1723-c8e4-44b9-af22-f66955eda1e2","metricMeasures":[]},{"annotations":[],"createdAt":"2020-11-16T12:36:52.81Z","text":null,"entityUuid":"05655914-e1f4-4578-a7d4-bae17579fce8","questionType":"OptionsQuestion","eventType":"AddQuestionEvent","title":"Will there be version numbers?","requiredPhaseUuid":null,"tagUuids":[],"uuid":"15b65ad2-f8f9-49c8-a42f-8f7d95ff5521","parentUuid":"facde7e9-8711-4ced-a6f8-5fbacf929381"},{"advice":null,"annotations":[],"createdAt":"2020-11-16T12:36:52.81Z","entityUuid":"f069d137-35c7-4fb3-974a-ba69e40a77e3","eventType":"AddAnswerEvent","label":"xx","uuid":"356e3745-27b8-41d2-8c4d-d4dd83263786","parentUuid":"05655914-e1f4-4578-a7d4-bae17579fce8","metricMeasures":[]},{"annotations":{"changed":false},"createdAt":"2020-11-16T12:36:52.81Z","text":{"changed":false},"entityUuid":"05655914-e1f4-4578-a7d4-bae17579fce8","questionType":"OptionsQuestion","eventType":"EditQuestionEvent","title":{"value":"How will the versions be recognised?","changed":true},"requiredPhaseUuid":{"changed":false},"tagUuids":{"changed":false},"uuid":"bf4b6187-c2b2-44d8-8b67-755f55c82641","expertUuids":{"changed":false},"parentUuid":"facde7e9-8711-4ced-a6f8-5fbacf929381","answerUuids":{"changed":false},"referenceUuids":{"changed":false}},{"advice":{"changed":false},"annotations":{"changed":false},"createdAt":"2020-11-16T12:36:52.81Z","entityUuid":"f069d137-35c7-4fb3-974a-ba69e40a77e3","eventType":"EditAnswerEvent","followUpUuids":{"changed":false},"label":{"value":"They will be dated","changed":true},"uuid":"2a7ac000-0866-45e7-92ee-bf9c41aca480","parentUuid":"05655914-e1f4-4578-a7d4-bae17579fce8","metricMeasures":{"changed":false}},{"advice":null,"annotations":[],"createdAt":"2020-11-16T12:36:52.81Z","entityUuid":"283e382c-e200-4b19-b461-6c3c45334742","eventType":"AddAnswerEvent","label":"They will be clearly numbered","uuid":"332e5e26-3046-4661-9464-bd488108af72","parentUuid":"05655914-e1f4-4578-a7d4-bae17579fce8","metricMeasures":[]},{"annotations":{"changed":false},"createdAt":"2020-11-16T12:36:52.81Z","text":{"value":"Imagine yourself trying to interpret a similar data set from a colleague in a few years. \nIs there any way in which the data could be misinterpreted?
